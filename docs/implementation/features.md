# Features

## Create and share projects

Heatflow.world allows you to group related datasets into a single project. The aim of this feature is to allow for project-level metadata (project-level contributors, funding details, descriptions, key dates, etc.) to be conveniently stored alongside each related dataset and sample within a project. This can effectively reduce the effort required to formally publish your related datasets by storing common metadata at a higher level. 

## Create, upload, publish and share datasets

Heatflow.world allows you to easily manage and publish your heat flow related datasets in accordance with community-defined standards.


## Track your contributions

Add contributors to any project, dataset or sample within the application. Contributors are assigned roles that reflect the DataCite metadata schema in order to ensure proper attribution of credit to all parties involved in data collection and dataset creation.


## Review historic datasets


## Organizations


## Literature Review

The Global Heat Flow Database web application provides a literature review interface that allows you to easily manage and publish your heat flow related literature reviews in accordance with community standards.
