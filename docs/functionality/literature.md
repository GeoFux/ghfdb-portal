# Literature Review

:::{note}
The optional literature review feature encourages community members to explore existing literature for potentially relevant data, fostering rapid database growth.
:::

While there has been a growing awareness of the importance of data sharing and transparency in scientific research, historically speaking, this has not been the case. Unfortunately, this means that many datasets are hidden away in supplementary files, or provided in tables and figures that make the data difficult to access, discover and reuse. The literature review addon for Geoluminate allows you to provide a list of existing literature items that are likely to contain data that are relevant to the database. Community members can then review these literature items, assessing them for any relevant data before submitting them for formal review and inclusion into the database. 

## How does it work?

This addon allows you to manage a seperate list of literature items that are not directly related to a dataset contained within the database. This list should contain literature items that have been marked by site administrators as probably containing data that are relevant to the database, but have not yet been added. This list of potential datasets is presented to the community, who can then select an item to review, assessing it's contents for data that are relevant to the database. During this process, a new dataset is created and submitted for internal review (just like any other dataset). Once the dataset has been reviewed and approved, it is added to the database and the literature item is removed from the list of potential datasets.

## What's the incentive?

The incentive for community members to review literature items is that their contributions are recorded and they will be credited as an author on the next full release of the database.
